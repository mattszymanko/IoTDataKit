// src/IoTDataException.cpp
// Include the header to ensure it compiles standalone.
// Definitions are typically in the header for simple exception classes,
// but this confirms linkage if definitions were moved here (they aren't currently).
#include "IoTDataException.h"

// No definitions needed here as they are inline in the header.
// This file primarily serves to potentially allow separate compilation
// of the exception classes if they became more complex, or for consistency.
